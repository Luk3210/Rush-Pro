I have lost interest in this game since the change where you can no longer queue dodge. It has become impossible to play this game as a new or returning player. Call me bad but I played this game for fun, not to have to tryhard. If you have an interest in maintaining this project please contact me at turb0techyt24@gmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

RushPro is a Hypixel Bedwars overlay that displays information about various Hypixel Bedwars maps to give you the upper hand without memorizing a lot of things.

You can download it on the releases page. The mc client's directory has to be at the default location provided during the client's installation to work.
